# quote-genius

A quotation creation app designed for ease of use and efficiency. The app should allow users to input product or service details, quantities, and prices to automatically generate professional-looking quotations. The interface should be user-friendly and intuitive, supporting multiple templates for different industries. Key features include the ability to save and edit drafts, export quotations in various formats (PDF, DOCX), and send them directly to clients via email. A sleek, modern design with a focus on simplicity and usability is essential, incorporating a color scheme of blues and whites for a professional look.
